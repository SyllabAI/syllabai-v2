# syllabai-v2 — multi-agent worklog (APPEND-ONLY)

Protocol: after each task (or meaningful attempt), append a section:

    ---
    Task ID: T-MIG-xxx
    Agent: <role><n> (<agent id>)
    Task: <one line>

    Work Log:
    - <steps>

    Stage Summary:
    - <results / decisions / deviations>

Never rewrite, reorder, or delete existing entries. On append conflict:
`git pull --rebase`, then re-append.

Task ID: T-MIG-SEED
Agent: R0-integrator (Super Z, operator session trace 347fbb29ca71934f658854f7261bdb83)
Task: Bootstrap the monorepo per operator directive 2026-10-04 ("Create the new repo, clone everything needed in there, create docs, set up, write the complete plan doc").

Work Log:
- Created GitHub repo SyllabAI/syllabai-v2 (public, main) — 2026-10-04
- Shallow-cloned frozen syllabai-hub @ 93226a43edefafb3bfa9d0fddf119948da29fa9a; imported full tree (153MB incl. 80MB content corpus) into apps/hub; pruned .git + .github/workflows; PROVENANCE.md records source+SHA+rules
- Scaffolded bun-workspaces monorepo: root scripts/tsconfig/.gitignore/CI; packages/contracts (zod, auth DTOs ported constraint-for-constraint from core identity DTOs — RegisterRequest 12-char letter+digit floor, join-code gate, UserView/AuthResponse shapes), packages/shared (parity-killer charter), packages/db (Drizzle + Neon serverless client, jdbc:-prefix guard, baseline doctrine)
- Scaffolded apps/api (Hono): GET /actuator/health live with exact {status:UP} parity; POST /api/auth/register|login validate via contracts then answer honest 501 (T-MIG-010 pending); fail-fast env gate ported (blank SYLLABAI_JWT_SECRET/DATABASE_URL refuses boot); bun tests green-by-construction seed
- Committed golden-master harness (golden/runner.ts: selftest + live replay, tolerance rules; cases/health.json) — CI runs selftest
- Wrote docs: MIGRATION_PLAN (waves 0-7, controller port map, risk register R-JWT..R-PII, cutover/rollback, catch-up, DoD), AGENT_COORDINATION (roles R0-R7, claim protocol, file-ownership fences, task yaml format, escalation, anti-patterns), GOLDEN_MASTER, BASELINE_DB, REFERENCE_DOCS (13 pack ADRs + core/hub doc maps with frozen-repo raw links)
- Seeded .syllabai/tasks/: T-MIG-000/001/002/003/010/011 (master-pack T-C42 yaml convention; scope.allowed fences)
- CI note: hub intentionally NOT in the CI build lane until T-MIG-000 (153MB corpus + bun install scope)

Stage Summary:
- Repo live: https://github.com/SyllabAI/syllabai-v2 · core/hub untouched (C1 honored) · same-Neon constraint embedded in docs + client code guards · next: assign agents to T-MIG-000/001/002/003 (three parallel lanes, disjoint files)
