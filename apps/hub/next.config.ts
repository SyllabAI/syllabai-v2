 *   React refresh runtime.
 * - styles: inline style attributes across the component tree + KaTeX.
 * - images: hotlinked corpus images live on raw.githubusercontent.com
 *   (ADR-013 posture unchanged).
 * - connect: same-origin API proxies + pdf.js range-fetches past-paper PDFs
 *   from raw.githubusercontent.com + the browser-direct core origin.
 * - frames: the KG explorer and graph explorer are SAME-ORIGIN self-frames
 *   (public/kg/*.html), so frame-ancestors is 'self' — 'none' would break our
 *   own embeds while 'self' still blocks cross-site framing (with
 *   X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN as the legacy fallback).
 * - fonts: pinned woff2 assets (src/fonts/) served same-origin via
 *   next/font/local — zero font network fetches at build or runtime;
 *   KaTeX ships with the bundle.
