/**
 * The paper-PDF matcher (F-022 tranche 2, hub side of core PR #66).
 *
 * Maps core's citation-header paper identity ({paperCode, sessionLabel,
 * role}) onto THIS repo's committed corpus index (lib/pastpapers-corpus) —
 * the same index the /courses/.../past-papers viewer is addressed by — and
 * returns the viewer URL for the real paper PDF, or null when nothing
 * matches honestly.
 *
 * The value vocabulary and its 2026-10-02 production audit live in
 * lib/paper-link-shared.ts. The failure posture, twice over:
 *
 *  - core can hand us a paper whose paperCode/sessionLabel are honestly
 *    NULL (the parser never guesses printed identity) — those resolve to
 *    null here, before any corpus work
 *  - the same paper code can exist under more than one spec folder (4CH1 vs
 *    4SD0 share "1C") — a course hint scopes the lookup; without one, more
 *    than one DISTINCT corpus file is ambiguity, and ambiguity is a null
 *
 * Server-only: the index JSON is a build-time module this repo deliberately
 * keeps out of client bundles (the client gets the resolved URL, nothing else).
