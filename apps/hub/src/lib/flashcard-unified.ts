/**
 * flashcard-unified — the hub consumption lane for the account rating
 * trail (T-C57 + T-C61). The device-local Ebbinghaus queue
 * (lib/flashcard-review.ts, tranche 4.8) sees every rating THIS browser
 * made; the account (core, the append-only V47 trail) sees every rating
 * THE ACCOUNT made. Neither is the whole truth alone — this module builds
 * the one queue the deck badges, the deck player and the My State / KG
 * drawer all read, from the best source available:
 *
 *   1. TRAIL (T-C61, ADR-034) — the bounded raw trail (GET
 *      /api/v1/learners/me/flashcard-rating-trail) walks completely, so
 *      each card's history is the TRUE chronological merge of the account
 *      events and this device's events, each flip exactly once, derived
 *      through the frozen ladder. This is strictly better than rung 2: a
 *      card rated on device A and offline on device B shows BOTH.
 *   2. FEED (T-C57) — the derived schedule feed
 *      (GET /api/v1/learners/me/flashcard-review-schedule): newest-
 *      evidence-wins per card. Preserved VERBATIM as the middle rung —
 *      chosen when the trail endpoint is unavailable (old core) or the
 *      walk cannot complete inside the client's page bound (the feed's
 *      server-side derivation covers the full account trail by
 *      construction, so correctness never depends on the walk finishing).
 *   3. DEVICE — the browser-local derivation alone, exactly what the
 *      queue read before T-C57 (off-pilot / signed out / core down).
 *
 * ── The true-merge rule (rung 1; honest by construction) ────────────────
 * Per card: account events + device entries receipted "local" + device
 * entries with NO receipt ONLY when the account has no events for that
 * card, sorted chronologically, capped at TRAIL_CAP (the frozen ladder
 * cannot overstate an interval beyond its cap, and the device keeps the
 * same window). Core stamps `occurred_at` SERVER-side — the same flip
 * cannot be recognized across sides by its timestamp — so the cross-side
 * identity is the SYNC RECEIPT the bridge persisted when the outcome was
 * known (ADR-034): "core" = the account copy exists (drop the device
 * copy), "local" = the account definitively lacks it (keep). A missing
 * receipt is honest history, not a bug: it might be the account's own
 * copy, so it is kept only where no account events exist to duplicate —
 * the conservative direction (a dropped offline event can only make a
 * card due EARLIER: over-practice, never under-practice).
 *
 * ── Scoping (the bridge gate, mirrored) ─────────────────────────────────
 * The account trail is course-agnostic and its cards carry no course
 * slug, so a course's queue may consume the account ONLY where the write
 * side would have synced: the registry-derived core-sync eligibility set
 * (lib/flashcard-sync-eligibility — T-C66; today exactly the pilot, since
 * core cannot anchor the other courses yet). The hook fetches only on
 * those courses, the EXACT predicate the write gate and the deck player's
 * honesty chip read — one predicate, three consumers, so the write and
 * read sides cannot drift: widen BOTH or neither is structural.
 *
 * ── Honesty pins (inherited, all preserved) ──────────────────────────────
 *   - self-report drives review TIMING only — never the mastery model
 *     (lib/forgetting.ts stays a separate arithmetic over measured attempts;
 *     the KG exposure/evidence paths in kg-learner-state.ts are untouched);
 *   - every core negative (signed out / core down / old core without the
 *     endpoints) degrades down the rungs — the queue never blocks, never
 *     spins, never invents;
 *   - cards never rated anywhere have no schedule at all;
 *   - nothing is persisted: the trail/feed are read on demand (plus a
 *     refetch when the bridge signals a fresh sync), held in hook state
 *     only (ADR-031 — computed at read, persisted nowhere).
