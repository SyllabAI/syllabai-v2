/**
 * Learner drawer state — KG phase 2 (My State + History).
 *
 * Layers the demo's honest answer to the web workbench's "My State" and
 * "History" surfaces on top of the phase-1 derivation: one derivation pass
 * (lib/learner-state.ts) feeds both the renderer overlay and this module's
 * drawer model, so the graph and the drawer can never disagree.
 *
 * What the drawer shows, and what it refuses to:
 *
 *   - My State: stored → effective mastery per touched spec point
 *     (effective = stored × Ebbinghaus retention, lib/forgetting.ts), the
 *     decay-derived review queue, exposure-only points and the awaiting-marks
 *     count. Bands mirror the renderer's paint (low <55 · developing 55–69 ·
 *     good 70–79 · strong ≥80) — computed on the EFFECTIVE number, like the
 *     web workbench's decayed bands.
 *   - Misconception watch (KG phase 3): the seeded sim learner's active /
 *     watching misconception states over the course's misconception corpus
 *     (SME/mark-scheme provenance). SIMULATED states, labelled as such — the
 *     demo has no distractor→misconception telemetry, so nothing here claims
 *     measured evidence; the corpus content itself is real, the STATE is the
 *     deterministic demo overlay.
 *   - History: the recorded evidence stream, newest first — facts only (what
 *     was answered, how it was marked, where it came from), never advice and
 *     no re-derived mastery. Typed drafts on questions without a self-score
 *     show the honest "awaiting marks" state; once a part is self-scored the
 *     draft is represented by its marked event, not by a stale awaiting row.
 *     Simulated misconception states are NOT history events — history is
 *     what the learner did, not what a model guesses.
 *
 * Everything derives from the browser-local progress store (SIMULATED,
 * browser-local, never written to course data) — the derivation is live, so
 * the drawer reflects the current store rather than a frozen log snapshot.
