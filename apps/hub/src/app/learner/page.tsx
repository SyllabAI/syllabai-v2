 * My Progress — the real learner model (ADR-029 tranche 4.1).

 * Rewired from the old simulated-overlay viewer: the page now renders the
 * SAME derivation that paints the Knowledge Graph and feeds its My State /
 * History drawer (lib/kg-learner-state.ts — one pass, so the page, the graph
 * and the drawer can never disagree). On the 4CH1 pilot with a signed-in
 * learner that is the CORE model — real attempts, real Ebbinghaus decay,
 * real review queue — labelled CORE_MEASURED; anything else degrades to the
 * honest browser-local simulation, labelled as such. The old fabricated
 * skill-state numbers are gone.
